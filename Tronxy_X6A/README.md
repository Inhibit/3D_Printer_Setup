Tronxy X6A setup, firmware (Marlin or Chitu), and slicer configuration files.

As of 02/25/21 the CURA settings seem to work better than the Prusa Slic3r configs.

12/30/2021 Update: I've added in a PrusaSlicer Config pack for Marlin running on the original Tronxy X6A Chituboard. It was generated with PrusaSlicer 2.4.0.
Restore this as a "config bundle" under the Import options in PrusaSlicer.
